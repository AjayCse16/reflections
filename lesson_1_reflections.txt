if a bug is introduced in some line that means the new version will have difference in the same line,
so we can remove the bug by viewing the diff.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

In manually committing there would be less versions to access rather in automatically saving there would lots of versions of the file.
but in case of documents it will be good if it saved automatically.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

since all the files in the repository are connect to each other so there is a need to save in one commit
while in Google Docs all files are independent so there is no need to save in one commit.
